Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface 
temperature due to human activities that release greenhouse gases into the 
atmosphere. Here are 10 significant causes of global warming:

1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions:
   The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy 
   releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. 
   CO2 is a major greenhouse gas that traps heat, contributing to global 
   warming.

2. Deforestation:
   The clearing of forests for agriculture, logging, and urban development 
   reduces the number of trees that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. This 
   results in an increased concentration of greenhouse gases and a reduced 
   capacity to mitigate global warming.

3. Methane Emissions:
   Agriculture and livestock farming contribute to methane emissions. 
   Cattle digestion, rice paddies, and manure management release significant 
   amounts of methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas with a higher 
   heat-trapping potential than CO2.

4. Nitrous Oxide from Agriculture:
   Agricultural practices, especially the use of synthetic fertilizers and 
   manure, release nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide 
   is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to the enhanced greenhouse 
   effect.

5. Industrial Processes:
   Certain industrial activities release greenhouse gases, including CO2 and 
   methane. For example, cement production involves the release of CO2 during 
   the chemical transformation of raw materials.

6. Waste Management:
   Improper disposal and decomposition of organic waste in landfills produce 
   methane. Inefficient waste management practices contribute to higher methane 
   emissions, exacerbating global warming.

7. Land Use Changes:
   Alterations in land use, such as urbanization and changes in agricultural 
   practices, can impact the balance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 
   Converting natural landscapes into developed areas can release stored carbon 
   and contribute to warming.

8. Use of Refrigerants:
   Certain synthetic chemicals used as refrigerants and in air conditioning 
   systems, known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), are potent greenhouse gases. 
   The release of HFCs into the atmosphere contributes to the warming of the 
   planet.
