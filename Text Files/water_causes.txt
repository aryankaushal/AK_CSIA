Water pollution occurs when harmful substances are introduced into water 
bodies, leading to adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems, human health, 
and the environment. Here are 10 common causes of water pollution:

1. Industrial Discharges:
   Industrial activities release various pollutants, such as heavy metals, 
   chemicals, and toxins, into water bodies through discharges of wastewater. 
   Improper disposal and inadequate treatment of industrial effluents contribute 
   significantly to water pollution.

2. Agricultural Runoff:
   The use of fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides in agriculture can result 
   in runoff during rainfall, carrying these chemicals into rivers, lakes, and 
   other water bodies. This runoff introduces nutrients and contaminants that 
   can harm aquatic life and degrade water quality.

3. Urban Runoff:
   Urban areas with impervious surfaces such as roads and pavements prevent 
   natural water infiltration. As a result, rainwater can pick up pollutants 
   like oil, heavy metals, and debris from streets, contributing to water 
   pollution when it enters stormwater drainage systems.

4. Wastewater Disposal:
   Improper disposal of domestic sewage and untreated wastewater from households 
   and urban areas can introduce pathogens, nutrients, and other contaminants into 
   water bodies. Inadequate sewage treatment facilities or the absence of proper 
   sanitation systems exacerbate this issue.

5. Oil Spills:
   Accidental or deliberate releases of oil into water bodies, often associated 
   with transportation, offshore drilling, or industrial activities, can have 
   severe ecological consequences. Oil spills coat aquatic surfaces, harm marine 
   life, and disrupt ecosystems.

6. Plastic Pollution:
   Improper disposal of plastic waste leads to plastic pollution in water bodies. 
   Plastics break down into smaller particles over time, known as microplastics, 
   which can be ingested by aquatic organisms, posing threats to marine life and 
   potentially entering the food chain.

7. Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs):
   Excessive nutrient inputs, often from agricultural runoff or untreated sewage, 
   can lead to the proliferation of harmful algal blooms. These blooms can produce 
   toxins that harm aquatic ecosystems, kill fish, and pose risks to human health 
   if contaminated water is consumed or used for recreational activities.

8. Heavy Metals:
   Industrial discharges, mining activities, and improper disposal of electronic 
   waste can introduce heavy metals like mercury, lead, and cadmium into water bodies. 
   These metals are toxic to aquatic life and can accumulate in organisms, posing risks 
   to both aquatic ecosystems and human health.
